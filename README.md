# chatbot

This is a chatbot that uses Natural Processing Language and deep learning . The user may ask a question whose answer already exists in the database.

    The script is designed to build and train a chatbot using deep learning with TensorFlow. Initially, it imports necessary libraries, including `random`, `json`, `pickle`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`, and `nltk`, to facilitate data manipulation, model building, and natural language processing. The chatbot's intents are loaded from a JSON file, which includes various conversational patterns and corresponding responses. The script then preprocesses this data by tokenizing and lemmatizing words, creating a list of unique words and classes, and converting patterns into bag-of-words vectors. These vectors are paired with the appropriate intent labels to form the training dataset.

The neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow's Sequential API. It consists of an input layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, a hidden layer with 64 neurons, and two dropout layers to prevent overfitting. The output layer uses softmax activation to provide a probability distribution over the possible classes. The model is compiled using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.01 and momentum, and it employs categorical cross-entropy as the loss function, suitable for multi-class classification tasks.

Training is performed on the processed data for 200 epochs with a batch size of 5, and the progress is displayed throughout the training process. Once training is complete, the model is saved to a file named 'chatbot_model.h5', making it available for future use in predicting the intent of user inputs. This model serves as the core component of an interactive chatbot, capable of classifying user inputs into predefined intents and facilitating meaningful conversations.
